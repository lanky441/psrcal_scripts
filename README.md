# psrcal_scripts

This repository contains the sripts for performing IFA, MEM, and MEM+METM calibration of pulsar profiles and generating TOAS from those calibrated profiles.
These scipts have been used for calibrating GBT GUPPI pulsar data observed by NANOGrav in [Dey et al. (2024)] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13463).
